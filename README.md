# Building-GWP-prediction
This code predicts the building Global warming potential (GWP) based on the features available in the data set.
The predictive models are advance machine learning algorithems: 1- CatBoostRegressor 2- Random Forest Regression 3- LGBMRegressor 4- Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The code also conducts the feature importance analysis by SHAP method.
The predictive models are developed and analysed by default hyper parameters and hyper parameter tuning.
The method for hyper parameter tuning: rendom dearch method(RandomizedSearchCV).
